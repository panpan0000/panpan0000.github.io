# Credits content
credits: 'RackHD is a technology stack for enabling automated hardware management and orchestration through cohesive APIs. It serves as an abstraction layer between other management layers and the underlying, vendor-specific physical hardware.
    
    Developers can use the RackHD APIs to incorporate RackHD functionality into a larger orchestration system or to create a user interface for managing hardware services regardless of the underlying hardware in place.'
